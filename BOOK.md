<h1 align="center" style="font-family: 'orbitron'">The Orbit Programming Language</h1>

So, you're looking to get into Orbit? This could mean one of two things:

1. You're interested in programming languages.
2. You've failed NASA's training programme and have Googled "get into orbit".

After reading this document you should have a good understanding of the language basics ~~and be able to successfully launch a Saturn V rocket~~.

This document is not a technical specification. Please see the grammar documentation if that's what you're looking for (nerd).

# *Massive Disclaimer*

***Orbit is very much a work in progress. Many important features are unimplemented. Very little is finalised. Expect bugs and breaking changes until v1.0.0 if you decide to get involved with the project. New stuff is being pushed everyday but don't expect stability for some time.***

Hi, I'm Troy McClure, you may remember me from such programming tutorials as "Python: What's the Deal with Semantic Whitespace?" and "Generics, Say's Who? - The Golang Story".

### What is *~~love~~* Orbit?

The Orbit programming language is a tool for building software. It is also an experiment in language design and implementaton.

Starting with the superset of all modern programming language features, what can be stripped away to make "getting it right" easier and safer? What classes of bug can we eliminate by design? What tasks can the compiler do for us that we currently do ourselves? Who framed Roger Rabbit?
